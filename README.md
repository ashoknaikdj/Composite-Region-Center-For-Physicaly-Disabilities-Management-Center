Each and every Organization having records which has to maintain for long period 
of time such as patient’s details, service provider, consultations, resource allocation, 
patient schedule appoint, visit registration, workers details etc.
Hospital Management System is designed for multispecialty hospitals, to cover a 
wide range of hospital administration and management process. It is an integrated endto-end Hospital Management System that provides relevant information across the 
hospital to support effective decision making for patient care, hospital administration and 
critical financial accounting, in a seamless flow. The Hospital Management System can be 
entered using username and password. It is accessible either by an administration or 
receptionist. Only they can add data into database. The data can be retrieved easily. The 
interface is very user friendly. The Data are well protected for personal use and makes 
the data processing very fast.
Hospital Management System is a software product suite designed to improve the 
quality and management of hospital management in the areas of clinical Process analysis 
and activity -based costing. Hospital Management System enables you to develop your 
organization and improve its effectiveness and quality of work. Managing the key process 
efficiently is critical to the success of the hospital helps to you manage your processes.

EXISTING SYSTEM
Traditionally there is no such system where we can store and access doctors,
workers, patient records and also any hospital related details. The following are fit falls 
of conventional system.
• In existing system all the activities are done manually in paper works.
• They keep all records in big paper file records.
• Due to the manual entry through paper work in the books duplicate entry or 
wrong entry may occur in the existing system, resulting in wasting time and 
resources.
• In the current system we need to keep a number of records related to the patient 
and want to enter the details of the patients and the entered manually.
• In this system only the administrator or hospital authority views the patient 
details and they want to enter the details of the patient. This is time consuming 
and has much cost. 
• It has difficult to search a record from thousands of such records and observed 
that patient or person can take information of treatment emergency. which 
creates problem.
• The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread 
though out the hospital management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) 
is incomplete or does not follow management standards. Forms are often lost in 
transit between department requiring a comprehensive auditing to ensure that no 
vital information is lost. Multiple copies of the same information exist in the 
hospital and may lead to inconsistencies in data in various data stores

PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Hospital Management has to handle records for many numbers of patient and 
maintenance was difficult. Though it has used an information system, Manual hospital 
systems were paper-based and difficult to maintain, expensive, more manpower required 
and unable to handle large records, The previous system was not efficient and there were 
issues of redundancy and consistency. The new system is to control the following 
information patient information , room availability ,staff and operating room schedules 
,and patient invoices. These services are to provide in an efficient cost-effective manner, 
with the goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such tasks. Hence 
there is need to upgrade the system with a computer-based information system. That is 
use to Hospital Management System.
PROPOSED SYSTEM
The design and implementation of a comprehensive Hospital Management System 
and user interface is to replace the current paper records. The new system is to used 
control the following information.
• Patient information.
• Room(ward) availability.
• Staff availability.
• Operating room schedule.
• Patient invoices. 
These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost-effective manner, with the 
goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such tasks.
